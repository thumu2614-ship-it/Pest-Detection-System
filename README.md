# Pest-Detection-System
Developed a web-based automated system to detect pests and diseases in 5 major crops (Tomato, Potato, Corn, Strawberry, and Brinjal) using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The system allows farmers to upload leaf images for real-time diagnosis and provides actionable control recommendations.
