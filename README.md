# AI-Based Pest Detection and Control System

This project is a deep learning-based solution designed to help Sri Lankan farmers identify pests and diseases in crops like Tomato, Strawberry, Corn, Potato, and Brinjal.

## Features
- **Disease Classification:** Uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify leaf images as healthy or diseased.
- **Web Interface:** A user-friendly Flask-based web app for uploading images and viewing results.
- **Actionable Insights:** Provides recommendations for pest control based on the diagnosis.
- **Analytics Dashboard:** Displays disease severity and potential yield impact.

## Technologies Used
- **Language:** Python
- **Deep Learning:** TensorFlow, Keras (CNN)
- **Backend:** Flask
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Tools:** Google Colab, VS Code

## How it Works
1. Upload a clear image of a plant leaf.
2. The CNN model processes the image and predicts the disease.
3. The system displays the diagnosis along with severity levels and treatment suggestions.
